In this post, I'll illustrate how to use pystockfish module to analyze a chess game.  This is for anyone who knows a bit of programming and is wondering how to analyze a chess game with those python skills.

What we'll build: A Python web API that accepts FEN and PGN, processes the game with stockfish, and then returns stockfish's best move.


{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
All code can be found on my Github
